## ðŸŽ¨ Fun Fact

Share a fun personal fact that showcases your personality outside of coding.

> Did you know that the first computer bug was quite literal? In 1947, when working on the Harvard Mark II computer, a moth got trapped in one of the relays, causing a malfunction. The engineers taped the moth to the logbook and wrote "First actual case of bug being found" â€“ and that's where the term "debugging" originates from!
